## Target Sum of Difference ##

Write a program to calculate and return the sum of absolute difference between the adjacent number in an array of positive integers from the position entered by the user.

*Note :* You are expected to write code in the *totalSum* function only which will receive three positional arguments:

1st : number of elements in the array
2nd : array
3rd : position from where the sum is to be calculated

**Test Case 1**

*Sample Input:*

> 7

> 11 22 12 24 13 26 14

> 5

*Sample Output:*

> 25

*Explanation*

The first parameter 7 is the size of the array. 
Next is an array of integers and input 5 is the position from where you have to calculate the Total Sum. 
The output  is 25 as per calculation below. 

| 26-13 | = 13

| 14-26 | =  12

Total Sum = 13 + 12 = 25

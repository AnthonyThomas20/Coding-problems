## Switch the char ##

**Problem Statement:**

You are given a function,

replaceCharacter(char str[], int n, char c1, char c2);

The function accepts a string  ‘str’ of length n and two characters ‘c1’ and ‘c2’ as its arguments . 
Implement the function to modify and return the string ‘str’ in such a way that all occurrences of ‘c1’ in original string are replaced by ‘c2’
and all occurrences of ‘c2’ in original string are replaced by ‘c1’.

*Assumption:* String Contains only lower-case alphabetical letters.

Note:

If both characters are not present in string or both of them are same , then return the string unchanged.

**Test Case:**

*Sample Input:*

> apples

> a

> p

*Sample Output:*

> paales

*Explanation:*

‘a’ in original string is replaced with ‘p’ and ‘p’ in original string is replaced with ‘a’, thus output is 'paales'.

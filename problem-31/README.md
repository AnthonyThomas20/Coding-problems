## Odd Eve ##

Write a program to find the difference between the elements at odd index and even index.

Note : You are expected to write code in the *findDifference* function only which receive the first parameter as the numbers of items in the array 
and second parameter as the array itself. You are not required to take the input from the console.

**Test Case 1**

*Sample Input:*

> 7

> 10 20 30 40 50 60 70

*Sample Output:*

> 40

*Explanation*

The first parameter 7 is the size of the array. 

Sum of element at even index of array is 10 + 30 + 50 + 70 = 160 and sum of elements at odd index of array is 20 + 40 + 60 = 120. 

The difference between both is 40

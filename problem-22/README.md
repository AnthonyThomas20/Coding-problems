## Epidemic Problem ##

There is a village. Many people died in this village last month due to epidemic. 
A news reporter went to the village to know the number of people died due to epidemic. 
Reporter asked Harry ( Head of the village ) about number of people died. 
Harry told the reporter that I will not tell you the exact number of people died 
but I can give you a word and if you reverse that word and count the number of character which are at the same place after reversing the word then 
that number is equal to the number of people died in the village. Help the reporter to solve this problem using your coding skills.

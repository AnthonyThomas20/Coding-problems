## Square Root ##

Write a program to display whether a number is the square root of a given number or not.

The first two lines would consist of two numbers respectively, where you have to check whether the second number is the square root of the first number or not. 
Display the output in the following format only.

1. If first number is negative then print "Please enter positive number"
2. If second number is zero then print "Invalid Input"
3. If second number(n2) is square root of first number(n1) then print "Square root of n1 is n2"
4. If second number(n2) is not a square root of first number(n1) then print "n2 is not the square root of n1"

Consider other cases as well.

**Test case 1**

*Sample Input:*

> 9

> 3

*Sample Output:*

> Square root of 9 is 3


**Test case 2**

## Overriding case ##

Given an array arr of size N. Ideally it should contain 1 to N numbers ( in no particular order ), but one number is overridden by any other value. Return the number which is overridden.

Constraints

1 <= N <= 500

**Input Format:**
First line be value of N.
There will be next N lines where each line will have positive integer.

**Output Format:** Print the number which is overridden.


**Test Case 1**

*Sample Input:*

> 5

> 2
1
100
5
3

*Sample Output:*

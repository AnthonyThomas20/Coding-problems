## Selective array ##

The function *sumOfValue* adds up all the numbers of the entered array, which are completely divisible by the entered value.

For example â€“ If the entered array is arr{1,2,3,4,5}, and the entered value is 2, then the output will be 2+4 = 6.

The function *sumOfValue* accepts three inputs:-
1. len which represents the length of the array
2. arr[] which represents the array of numbers
3. value which represents the value that will be entered by the user.

Sample output:

> 6
